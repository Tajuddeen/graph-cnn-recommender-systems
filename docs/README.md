**Progress**
* Read the three papers
* Project plan completed
* Code for three methods briefly explored

**Some insights**
* Multi-graphs: Graphs that are permitted to have multiple/parallel edges; where two vertices can be connected by more than one edge.

**Some questions**
* How to apply residual gated graph convnets to recommender systems?
* What does fixed/variable length graph mean?
* Does [Geometric Matrix Completion with Recurrent Multi-Graph Neural Networks (Monti, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06803) work only with fixed length graphs? [Residual Gated Graph ConvNets (Bresson, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07553) is applicable for graphs with variable length.

**Brief outline of project:**

Investigate different graph CNN approaches as recommender systems. The 3 methods to be compared are as follows.
1. [Geometric Matrix Completion with Recurrent Multi-Graph Neural Networks (Monti, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06803)
1. [Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion (Berg, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02263)
1. [Residual Gated Graph ConvNets (Bresson, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07553)

The third approach (Bresson, 2018) proposes a novel architecture for graph learning tasks, incorporating gated edges and residuality with graph ConvNets. The challenge will be to apply this architecture to recommender system tasks.
